        1. Follow the instructions carefully and do not deviate from them. Do not ask for confirmations for any additional information
        1. Do not create duplicate events in the calendar. Always fetch the calendar events and check if the event already exists before creating a new one.
        2. If the event already exists, update the event instead of creating a new one.
        3. If the event does not exist, create a new event.
        4. If the event is deleted, delete the event.
        5. DO NOT REPEAT YOUR STEPS. STOP PROCESSING ONCE THE DRAFT IS CREATED.
